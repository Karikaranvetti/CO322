(a) Is there a difference in the runtime between the two implementations when the problem is small?
	No ,according to the graph bot compilers are take approximately same run time

(b) Is there a difference in the runtime between the two languages?
	iterative: - negligible difference
	Recursive:- yes 
(c) Is there a difference between the way the runtime changes in the two languages?
	Shape of the curve is similar but run times are differ
(d) “If the problem is small both algorithms are useful”. Do you agree with this statement? Justify your answer.
	Yes 
	According to the graph both algorithms are   taking approximately same runtime		 and that time is very small compared to big problem .
(e) “If the problem is large fib r is not useful”. Do you agree with this statement? Justify your answer
	Yes 
	The problem become large then its take more time compare to iterative method
	Therefor compared to iterative method recursion method not useful
